### *The USA lags behind other agricultural nations in banning harmful pesticides*


### About Makeover Monday

[MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project:
"Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart.
Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data.
We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.
Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

### Makeover Monday 20200113

This week’s dataset is very close to our daily life – it’s about how many of the pesticides used in USA agriculture are actually banned in EU, China and Brazil. The original viz can be found here. It is kind of confusing to understand the chart as it’s showing number of pesticides banned in one country side by side with the number of pesticides banned in at least one or two or three countries…
Also, somehow the dataset provided tells the weight of those pesticides, instead of number of kinds as in the original viz.
The The original viz can be found [here](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-019-0488-0/figures/1). I don't think this visualization use the dataset provided to us, which took me a while to figure out how to deal with the data.

#### My Visualization

I found the [dataset](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12940-019-0488-0/MediaObjects/12940_2019_488_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx) used to create the original viz. But I did my viz based on the provided dataset, and hope to find time to explore this new dataset and derive some insights from it. 
The percentages has the same distribution as Lbs, so I only do bar plot on Lbs, because I don't think percentage makes any sense (pesticides banned in at least one country contains pesticides banned in EU or in Brazil or in China, so there has to be some overlaps within each category. As a result, percentage is not very valid.

#### Insights
* More than 300 million pesticides that are used in US are banned by EU, compared to only 25 million banned in Brazil and 40 million banned in China;
* Different countries have different standard about the safety of pesticides, but we might be able to conclude that EU is much more strict about the use of pesticides than US;
* One thing worth considering is whether we should make our standard higher for pesticides since they are directly related to people's health.
